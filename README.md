# Advanced Lane Finding Project

## Overview
This is project 2 from Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program. \

The final output of this project is finding a lane on the road, drawing it, and computing vehicle's position with respect to center of the lane, as well as the radius of a lane's curvature.

The steps of this project are the following:
1. Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
1. Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
1. Apply a perspective transform to rectify an image ("birds-eye view").
1. Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
1. Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
1. Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
1. Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
1. Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.
